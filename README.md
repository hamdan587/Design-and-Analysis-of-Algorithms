## üß© Algorithms Implemented

### 1. **Burfi Making Profit Problem** üç¨

#### Problem Description:
Maximize the profit from making and selling Burfi by considering limited ingredients and time constraints.

#### Approaches:
- **Top-Down Memoization**: Uses recursion with memoization to store intermediate results.
- **Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming**: Builds the solution iteratively using a dynamic programming table.

#### Time Complexity:
- **Top-Down**: `O(n * m)`
- **Bottom-Up**: `O(n * m)`

### 2. **Pattern Occurrences in Matrix** üîç

#### Problem Description:
Given a matrix and a pattern, find how many times the pattern occurs within the matrix.

#### Approach:
- **Brute Force Search**: Iterate over all possible submatrices and check for matches.

#### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(matrixRows * matrixCols * patternDim^2)`

---

### 3. **Graph Algorithms** üåê

#### Shortest Cycle in a Graph:
Uses the **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** to find the shortest cycle in a weighted graph by checking all pairs of vertices.

#### Approach:
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Computes all-pairs shortest paths and detects cycles by checking distances for each vertex.

#### Time Complexity:
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: `O(n^3)` where `n` is the number of vertices.
